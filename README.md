#Objectives
- Explore data pulled from various Kaggle competitions
- Clean and standardize data for future processing
- Apply various regression techniques
- Create and optimize a prediction model

#Background
Using data from Kaggle's (NYC rental listing inquiries competition)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries] and the (Blue Book for Bulldozers)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data] auction price prediction competition, follow the cleaning and modeling guideline in the (Mechanics of Machine Learning)[https://mlbook.explained.ai/] book to create a prediction model for the two datasets.

The first model should be able to predict the rent on a new rental listing in NYC, and the second model would predict the auction price for a bulldozer given certain features and details.
